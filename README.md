# Random rounding
Random rounding of numbers with probability of ceiling vs flooring proportional to decimal. For Xiaoyan's code.

## Examples

- `7.5` becomes `7` (floored) with 50% chance, and becomes `8` (ceiled) with 50% chance.
- `6.6` becomes `6` (floored) with 40% chance, and becomes `7` (ceiled) with 60% chance.
